## About

You work in an R&D environment and are responsible for the development
or testing of CANopen devices? Or you are an application engineer and
need a practical tool to communicate within a CANopen network?

Then CANopenTerm is exactly the right thing for you, because it was
developed for exactly this purpose. CANopenTerm is an interactive
terminal that communicates via external CAN hardware on the BUS. In
addition to an integrated help for each command, a Lua API is also
available, which can be used to automate recurring tasks, such as
writing and reading an EDS, generating traffic, etc.
